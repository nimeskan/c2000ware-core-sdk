# Phase 1 -- EPWM -> MCPWM Sync/Time-base Migration Report

## What this phase does, and doesn't, do

This phase inspects a source EPWM-based `.syscfg` file, works out how its
EPWM instances are wired together (the sync chain), and reports which EPWM
instances *could* be consolidated onto a single MCPWM instance on a target
device, and what their combined time-base/sync settings would need to be.

It stops at the report. It does not open, add, or edit any MCPWM module
instance, and it does not write any `.syscfg` file. That is deliberate --
treat "propose the equivalent MCPWM settings as configuration changes" as
out of scope for this phase even if it would be easy to continue further.
Writing to the target file is phase 2's job
(`references/phase2-instance-setup.md`), and only once the user has
confirmed this phase's output.

**Why the sync chain matters here:** a single MCPWM instance shares *one*
time-base counter (`TBCTR`) across all of its PWM output pairs. Two EPWM
instances can only become two pairs of the *same* MCPWM instance if they
already run off compatible time bases -- same period, same clock divider,
same counter mode -- and any relative phase between them has to be
achievable through the counter-compare submodule instead of two independent
counters. EPWM instances that are already synchronized to each other via
SyncIn/SyncOut are exactly the candidates worth checking first, since that
sync relationship is what a shared MCPWM counter is standing in for.

## Inputs

This phase needs three things, gathered from the user before starting (the
orchestrating `SKILL.md` may already have collected these):

1. **Source device** -- the device the source `.syscfg` file targets.
2. **Source `.syscfg` file** -- absolute path to the file to analyze.
3. **Target device** -- an MCPWM-capable device to migrate toward.

If any of these are missing, ask before proceeding -- don't guess a device
or file path.

## Tools used

All steps below use the SysConfig MCP server's tools. If you haven't
inspected this server's tools yet in the current session, expect roughly
this set: `openFile`, `getModuleInstances`, `getInstanceConfiguration`,
`addModuleInstances`, `removeModuleInstances`, `listFiles`, `closeFile`.
Call `tools/list` (or just try `openFile`) if you're unsure of exact
parameter names -- the ones below reflect a live-verified server, but
confirm before trusting field names blindly on a different server version.

## Step-by-step procedure

### Step 1 -- Open the source file

Call `openFile` with the source `.syscfg` file's absolute path.

Before doing this, `grep` the file for `@v2CliArgs` in its header comment:

```
grep "@v2CliArgs" <source .syscfg path>
```

If that header is **absent**, the *first* time this specific file is opened
via the MCP server, `openFile` can hang indefinitely on a GUI
device-selection dialog the MCP client has no way to answer (a known,
reproducible limitation -- not a timing fluke). If you hit this, it needs a
GUI-side click to resolve (see the project's CCS/MCP walkthrough doc for
the exact mechanism); don't just keep re-sending `openFile` with a longer
timeout expecting it to resolve itself.

### Step 2 -- Enumerate the EPWM instances

Call `getModuleInstances` with `moduleIds: ["/driverlib/epwm.js", "/driverlib/sync.js"]`
-- these are the two concrete, live-verified module ids: `/driverlib/epwm.js`
is every EPWM peripheral instance, `/driverlib/sync.js` is the device-level
sync-routing module (a single shared `$static` instance, not per-EPWM).
Record every EPWM instance's `moduleInstanceId` (typically `myEPWM1`,
`myEPWM2`, ... but read the actual ids returned, don't assume the naming).
Note any `parentInstances`/`childInstances` relationships reported -- the
`/driverlib/sync.js` instance being present at all, parented under
`/driverlib/epwm.js`'s `$static` instance, is itself the signal that this
device does some of its cross-peripheral sync-source selection at the
device level rather than per-EPWM-instance, which is what Step 4 checks.

### Step 3 -- Pull time-base and sync settings for every EPWM instance

Call `getInstanceConfiguration` **once**, `moduleId: "/driverlib/epwm.js"`,
passing all EPWM instances found in Step 2 in the `instances` array, with
`ids` set to this exact, live-verified list:

```
[
  "epwmTimebase_period",
  "epwmTimebase_clockDiv",
  "epwmTimebase_hsClockDiv",
  "epwmTimebase_counterMode",
  "epwmTimebase_counterValue",
  "epwmTimebase_periodLoadMode",
  "epwmTimebase_periodLoadEvent",
  "epwmTimebase_periodLink",
  "epwmTimebase_periodGld",
  "epwmTimebase_phaseEnable",
  "epwmTimebase_phaseShift",
  "epwmTimebase_forceSyncPulse",
  "epwmTimebase_syncInPulseSource",
  "epwmTimebase_syncOutPulseMode",
  "epwmTimebase_oneShotSyncOutTrigger"
]
```

Set `includeDescriptions: false` -- these ids are unambiguous enough that
descriptions just cost tokens for no benefit here.

**Important quirk confirmed by a live capture:** `epwmTimebase_phaseShift`
is a *conditional* configurable -- SysConfig only reports it for an
instance when that same instance's `epwmTimebase_phaseEnable` is `true`.
On an instance where phase-shift is disabled, `epwmTimebase_phaseShift`
will simply be **absent** from that instance's returned configuration --
that's expected, not a wrong id or a bug. Don't substitute a guessed id
(e.g. `epwmTimebase_phase`) if you don't see a phase value; it silently
returns nothing for an unrecognized id, which looks identical to "not
applicable" unless you know to expect that. If you need the phase value
for an instance that has `phaseEnable: true` and it didn't come back
(e.g. because this id list changes on a future SysConfig version), re-query
just that instance with `searchText: "phase"` rather than assuming it
doesn't exist.

Do this as a single call across all instances rather than one call per
instance -- it's cheaper and makes the values directly comparable.

### Step 4 -- Check device-level sync routing, if applicable

If Step 2 revealed a separate shared sync-routing instance, it will be
`moduleId: "/driverlib/sync.js"`, typically instance id `$static`. Call
`getInstanceConfiguration` on it with `searchText: "sync"` rather than a
hardcoded `ids` list -- **the configurable set here varies by device
family**, confirmed directly in this SDK's `driverlib/.meta/sync.js`:

- Every device family exposes at least `syncOutSource` (which peripheral's
  sync-out drives the external `EXTSYNCOUT` pin) and `syncOutLock` (a lock
  bit guarding that source selection) -- these two are safe to expect
  everywhere.
- Some families (confirmed for F2837xD/F2837xS/F2807x/F28004x in this SDK)
  add per-peripheral device-level sync-in routing configurables named
  `epwm<N>SyncInSource` and `ecap<N>SyncInSource` for specific instance
  numbers -- e.g. `epwm4SyncInSource`, `ecap1SyncInSource`. These do not
  exist on every family, and which instance numbers get one depends on the
  device, which is exactly why this step searches instead of assuming a
  fixed list.

Whatever comes back, read it for one thing: does it corroborate which EPWM
instance is the true sync root (i.e. is that same instance's sync-out also
the one selected as `syncOutSource`)? That cross-check is what makes Step 5
reliable instead of just trusting each instance's own settings in
isolation.

### Step 5 -- Reconstruct the sync chain

From the values gathered in Steps 3-4, build the sync topology by hand:

- Which EPWM instance is the **sync root** -- i.e., its sync-in source is
  external or otherwise not another EPWM's sync-out (nothing upstream of
  it in the chain)?
- For every other instance, which upstream instance's sync-out feeds its
  sync-in, and in what mode (pulse-on-zero, pulse-on-period, one-shot)?
- For each instance with phase-shift load enabled, is the effective phase
  offset zero (meaning it's really just following the root's counter with
  no offset) or non-zero (a genuine phase relationship that would need to
  be re-expressed via counter-compare on a shared MCPWM counter, since
  MCPWM has one counter per instance, not one per pair)?
- Are there EPWM instances with **no** sync relationship to the others at
  all (independent period/clock, no sync-in from a sibling)? These are not
  consolidation candidates with the rest and should be flagged separately.

### Step 6 -- Determine target-device MCPWM capacity

Each MCPWM instance always exposes exactly three PWM output pairs
(confirmed via the fixed `1A/1B`, `2A/2B`, `3A/3B` naming baked into every
MCPWM instance's action-qualifier configurables on a live-inspected
instance) -- there's no separate "number of pairs" setting to query. What
does vary by device is how many separate MCPWM instances the target device
has. To determine that for the target device:

- If a `.syscfg` file already targeting the target device is open (or can
  be opened) in the workspace, call `getModuleInstances` with
  `moduleIds: ["/driverlib/mcpwm.js"]` (the concrete MCPWM module id) to
  see what's already present, then `addModuleInstances` with
  `moduleIds: ["/driverlib/mcpwm.js"]` repeated once per extra instance you
  want to test, and `maxConfigurables: 0` (skip the representative-config
  payload -- you only care whether the add succeeds) to discover how many
  the device supports. It will return an error instead of an added instance
  once you exceed the hardware count.
  **Do not call `save` during this probe** -- added test instances stay
  in-memory only and are discarded once the MCP client disconnects; calling
  `save` would actually write them into that file, which is a real,
  user-visible change to a project you were only supposed to be inspecting.
- If no such file exists yet, note this as a gap in the report rather than
  guessing a pair/instance count -- the target device's data sheet or TRM
  is the authoritative source, and this phase's job is the EPWM-side
  analysis, not confirming target hardware limits from scratch.

### Step 7 -- Produce the report

Do not include any guidance on the mechanics of creating the target
`.syscfg` file, calling `addModuleInstances`/`changeConfiguration` for
MCPWM, or naming target instances -- that is explicitly out of scope for
this phase's output (it belongs to phase 2). The report is the
deliverable; use exactly this structure and section order so nothing gets
left out:

**1. Sync topology.** One sentence naming the sync root (which EPWM
instance, and how you know -- e.g. it's the one selected in the
device-level `syncOutSource` from Step 4), then one line per other
instance: which upstream instance's sync-out feeds it, and in what pulse
mode. If any instance has no sync relationship to the rest at all, name it
here explicitly as independent.

**2. Time-base compatibility.** State plainly whether all instances in the
sync chain share the same period, clock divider(s), and counter mode --
these three matching is the hard requirement for sharing an MCPWM counter.
Call out any instance that doesn't match and on which field, since that
instance can't join the others on one MCPWM counter regardless of its sync
relationship.

**3. Target capacity check.** State the result of Step 6 in numbers: how
many MCPWM instances (at 3 pairs each) the source's EPWM instances would
require, and whether the target device was confirmed (or not) to have that
many available.

**4. Per-instance settings table.** One row per **source EPWM instance**:

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| EPWM instance | `moduleInstanceId` from Step 2 |
| Period | value from Step 3 |
| Clock divider(s) | value(s) from Step 3 (`epwmTimebase_clockDiv` / `epwmTimebase_hsClockDiv`) |
| Counter mode | value from Step 3 |
| Period load mode / event | values from Step 3 (`epwmTimebase_periodLoadMode` / `epwmTimebase_periodLoadEvent`) |
| Sync-in source | value from Step 3, resolved to which instance/external signal it names |
| Sync-out mode | value from Step 3 |
| Phase-shift enable / value | `epwmTimebase_phaseEnable`, and `epwmTimebase_phaseShift` when present (state the offset both as a raw count and as a percentage of that instance's period, e.g. "300 / 2000 = 15%") |
| One-shot sync-out trigger | value from Step 3 |
| Sync role | Root / Synced (from `<X>`) / Independent, per section 1 |
| Consolidation candidate? | Yes, with which sibling instances, if period + clock divider + counter mode all match and it's part of the same sync chain; No, with the specific mismatching field(s) named, otherwise |

**5. Proposed grouping and open flags.** This is the section that turns
sections 1-4 into something actionable, so don't skip it or leave it
implicit in the table:

- Partition the consolidation candidates into groups of at most 3 (one
  MCPWM instance's pair capacity per group), stating which EPWM instances
  land in which group.
- For every relationship that crosses a group boundary (i.e. two EPWM
  instances that are sync-linked in the source but end up assigned to
  *different* MCPWM instances), flag it explicitly by name -- that
  relationship can no longer ride a shared counter and would need an
  inter-MCPWM-instance sync link instead. Don't let this fall out silently
  just because the grouping made it necessary.
- For every non-zero phase-shift value inside a group that does share one
  MCPWM instance, flag by name that it needs to be re-expressed via
  counter-compare rather than an independent counter, since the group's
  pairs all share one `TBCTR`.

### Step 8 -- Stop and confirm before going further

**End your turn after presenting the report.** Do not, in the same turn or
without being asked, proceed to open the target device's `.syscfg`, add or
configure any MCPWM instance, or start writing conversion code -- even
though the report may make the next step look obvious. Ask the user to
review the grouping and flagged relationships in section 5 specifically,
since that's where a judgment call was made (how to partition instances
into groups of <=3) that the user may want to override -- e.g. a different
grouping that keeps a different set of instances together, or a decision
about how to handle a flagged cross-group sync relationship. Only continue
into phase 2 once the user explicitly confirms the report and says to
proceed -- at that point, switch to `references/phase2-instance-setup.md`.
