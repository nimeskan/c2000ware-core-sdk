This is the complete set of these configurable ids tracked across all EPWM
device families. A real source instance will only expose whichever of
these its specific device supports -- that's expected, not a gap.

## What this sub-phase does, and doesn't, do

Migrates counter-compare configuration (`CMPA`-`CMPD`, their shadow-load
modes, and the global-load/link toggles) from each source EPWM instance
onto its assigned MCPWM instance and pair, per the confirmed phase-2
grouping. Does not touch action-qualifier, dead-band, trip-zone, or
event-trigger -- those are separate sub-phases.

## Inputs

From the confirmed phase-1 report and phase-2's applied setup, you need:

1. **Source device** and **source `.syscfg` file**.
2. **Target device** and **target `.syscfg` file** -- already has the MCPWM
   instances phase 2 created.
3. **The confirmed group -> MCPWM instance mapping** from phase 2 -- which
   source EPWM `moduleInstanceId` landed on which pair (1/2/3) of which
   target `moduleInstanceId`.

If any of these weren't part of the confirmed phase-2 output, ask before
proceeding rather than re-deriving or guessing them.

## Step-by-step procedure

### Step 1 -- Get migration guidance for this submodule's fields

Call `get_syscfg_module_migration_guide` with:

- `source_device`: the source device
- `target_device`: the target device
- `module_to_module`: `"epwm_mcpwm"`
- `ids`: the list above (or, cheaper, first narrow it to just the ids that
  actually exist on the source instances -- query `getInstanceConfiguration`
  with the full list and see what comes back; an id the device doesn't have
  is silently omitted from the response rather than causing an error)

This tool may not be available in every environment. If it isn't present or
the call fails, **stop and tell the user** rather than trying to
reconstruct this submodule's field-by-field mapping from memory or from
any locally-cached data -- that's exactly the gap this tool is meant to
fill, not something to work around silently.

The tool's response uses the same status model already established for
time-base/sync in phase 1: `mapped` (with a target MCPWM field name),
`no_equivalent`, or `partial` (a structural change, not a rename -- read
its guidance carefully rather than treating it like an ordinary rename).

### Step 2 -- Resolve pair-substitution and shared-field conflicts

`CMPA` and `CMPB` are **per-pair** on MCPWM -- a single MCPWM instance
exposes `mcpwmCounterCompare_cmpA`/`cmpB` (and their shadow-enable/
shadow-mode counterparts) for pair 1, then `..._pwm2` variants for pair 2
and `..._pwm3` variants for pair 3. The tool's guidance in Step 1 gives you
the pair-1 field name -- for the second and third source EPWM instance in a
group, append `_pwm2`/`_pwm3` to that field name yourself; the tool has no
way to know which pair a given source instance landed on.

`CMPC` and `CMPD`, by contrast, are genuinely **shared across all 3 pairs**
of one MCPWM instance -- there is no `_pwm2`/`_pwm3` variant for them at
all. If more than one source instance in a group used `CMPC`/`CMPD` with
different values, that is not a pair-substitution problem, it's a
reconciliation one: surface the conflicting values to the user and ask
which should be kept, rather than silently picking the first instance's
value.

The `*Gld`/`*Link` fields (global-load enable, register-link) are expected
to come back `no_equivalent` from the tool -- MCPWM's global-load model for
counter-compare is simpler (see phase 3f, Global Load).

### Step 3 -- Apply the translated values

For each target MCPWM instance, call `changeConfiguration` once (batch that
instance's fields into a single call so they apply atomically; use a
separate call per instance so one instance's failure doesn't revert
another's).

### Step 4 -- Verify

Call `getErrorsAndWarnings`. Confirm it comes back clean before presenting
anything as done -- resolve or report any error/warning before moving on.

### Step 5 -- Save and present the result for confirmation

Call `save`. Then present a report with:

1. **Values applied per target instance** -- pull via `getInstanceConfiguration`
   with `changesOnly: true` on the target instances so the report reflects
   what's actually in the file.
2. **Fields dropped** (`no_equivalent` per the tool) that had a non-default
   value on the source side -- name the source instance and the original
   value, don't just note the id was dropped.
3. **Every pair-substitution / reconciliation decision made explicitly**
   (see Step 2 above) -- which source instance's value was kept, and what
   happened to the others.
4. **Verification result** -- confirm `getErrorsAndWarnings` was clean and
   the file was saved.

### Step 6 -- Stop and confirm before the next sub-phase

**End your turn after presenting the report.** Do not proceed directly to
the next phase-3 sub-phase file in the same turn -- return to
`phase3-overview.md` first, which is where the next sub-phase gets picked
from. Ask the user to review the pair-substitution/reconciliation
decisions from Step 2 specifically, since that's where a judgment call was
made that the user may want to override.
