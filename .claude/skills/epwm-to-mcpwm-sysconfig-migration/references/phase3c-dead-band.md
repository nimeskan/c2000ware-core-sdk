This is the complete set of these configurable ids tracked across all EPWM
device families. A real source instance will only expose whichever of
these its specific device supports -- that's expected, not a gap.

## What this sub-phase does, and doesn't, do

Migrates dead-band configuration (rising/falling edge delay, polarity,
input/output swap, shadow-load settings) from each source EPWM instance
onto its assigned MCPWM instance. Does not touch counter-compare,
action-qualifier, trip-zone, or event-trigger.

## Inputs

From the confirmed phase-1 report and phase-2's applied setup, you need:

1. **Source device** and **source `.syscfg` file**.
2. **Target device** and **target `.syscfg` file** -- already has the MCPWM
   instances phase 2 created.
3. **The confirmed group -> MCPWM instance mapping** from phase 2 -- which
   source EPWM `moduleInstanceId` landed on which pair (1/2/3) of which
   target `moduleInstanceId`.

If any of these weren't part of the confirmed phase-2 output, ask before
proceeding rather than re-deriving or guessing them.

## Step-by-step procedure

### Step 1 -- Get migration guidance for this submodule's fields

Call `get_syscfg_module_migration_guide` with:

- `source_device`: the source device
- `target_device`: the target device
- `module_to_module`: `"epwm_mcpwm"`
- `ids`: the list above (or, cheaper, first narrow it to just the ids that
  actually exist on the source instances -- query `getInstanceConfiguration`
  with the full list and see what comes back; an id the device doesn't have
  is silently omitted from the response rather than causing an error)

This tool may not be available in every environment. If it isn't present or
the call fails, **stop and tell the user** rather than trying to
reconstruct this submodule's field-by-field mapping from memory or from
any locally-cached data -- that's exactly the gap this tool is meant to
fill, not something to work around silently.

The tool's response uses the same status model already established for
time-base/sync in phase 1: `mapped` (with a target MCPWM field name),
`no_equivalent`, or `partial` (a structural change, not a rename -- read
its guidance carefully rather than treating it like an ordinary rename).

### Step 2 -- Resolve the shared-field reconciliation, not a pair substitution

Every dead-band field is **instance-wide** on MCPWM -- confirmed live, a
single MCPWM instance exposes exactly one `mcpwmDeadband_*` field set, with
no `_pwm2`/`_pwm3` variants at all. That means dead-band settings apply to
**all 3 pairs** of that instance simultaneously; there is no per-pair
dead-band the way there is for `CMPA`/`CMPB` or action-qualifier outputs.

If a confirmed group has more than one source EPWM instance, and their
original dead-band settings differ (different `delayRED`/`delayFED`
values, different polarity, etc.), there is no way to preserve more than
one set on that shared MCPWM instance. Surface this explicitly to the user
-- name each source instance and its dead-band values -- and ask which one
should become the group's shared setting, rather than silently picking the
first (or any) instance's values.

If a group has only one source EPWM instance, there's nothing to
reconcile -- just carry that instance's values across via the tool's
`mapped` guidance.

### Step 3 -- Apply the translated values

For each target MCPWM instance, call `changeConfiguration` once (batch that
instance's fields into a single call so they apply atomically; use a
separate call per instance so one instance's failure doesn't revert
another's).

### Step 4 -- Verify

Call `getErrorsAndWarnings`. Confirm it comes back clean before presenting
anything as done -- resolve or report any error/warning before moving on.

### Step 5 -- Save and present the result for confirmation

Call `save`. Then present a report with:

1. **Values applied per target instance** -- pull via `getInstanceConfiguration`
   with `changesOnly: true` on the target instances so the report reflects
   what's actually in the file.
2. **Fields dropped** (`no_equivalent` per the tool) that had a non-default
   value on the source side -- name the source instance and the original
   value, don't just note the id was dropped.
3. **Every pair-substitution / reconciliation decision made explicitly**
   (see Step 2 above) -- which source instance's value was kept, and what
   happened to the others.
4. **Verification result** -- confirm `getErrorsAndWarnings` was clean and
   the file was saved.

### Step 6 -- Stop and confirm before the next sub-phase

**End your turn after presenting the report.** Do not proceed directly to
the next phase-3 sub-phase file in the same turn -- return to
`phase3-overview.md` first, which is where the next sub-phase gets picked
from. Ask the user to review the pair-substitution/reconciliation
decisions from Step 2 specifically, since that's where a judgment call was
made that the user may want to override.
