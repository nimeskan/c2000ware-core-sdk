# Phase 3f -- Global-Load Migration

## SysConfig IDs covered by this sub-phase

```
epwmGlobalLoad_enableOneShot
epwmGlobalLoad_gld
epwmGlobalLoad_gldMode
epwmGlobalLoad_gldPeriod
epwmGlobalLoad_globalePWMLoadLink
epwmGlobalLoad_oneShotForce
epwmGlobalLoad_oneShotMode
epwmGlobalLoad_statusActionQualifier
epwmGlobalLoad_statusCounterCompare
epwmGlobalLoad_statusDeadBand
epwmGlobalLoad_statusTimeBase
```

This is the complete set of these configurable ids tracked across all EPWM
device families. A real source instance will only expose whichever of
these its specific device supports -- that's expected, not a gap.

## What this sub-phase does, and doesn't, do

Migrates the top-level global-load configuration (one-shot force/mode,
global-load enable/mode/period, and the per-submodule global-load status
flags) from each source EPWM instance onto its assigned MCPWM instance.
Does not touch counter-compare, action-qualifier, dead-band, trip-zone, or
event-trigger's own submodule-specific load toggles (those are covered in
their respective sub-phases).

## Inputs

From the confirmed phase-1 report and phase-2's applied setup, you need:

1. **Source device** and **source `.syscfg` file**.
2. **Target device** and **target `.syscfg` file** -- already has the MCPWM
   instances phase 2 created.
3. **The confirmed group -> MCPWM instance mapping** from phase 2 -- which
   source EPWM `moduleInstanceId` landed on which pair (1/2/3) of which
   target `moduleInstanceId`.

If any of these weren't part of the confirmed phase-2 output, ask before
proceeding rather than re-deriving or guessing them.

## Step-by-step procedure

### Step 1 -- Get migration guidance for this submodule's fields

Call `get_syscfg_module_migration_guide` with:

- `source_device`: the source device
- `target_device`: the target device
- `module_to_module`: `"epwm_mcpwm"`
- `ids`: the list above (or, cheaper, first narrow it to just the ids that
  actually exist on the source instances -- query `getInstanceConfiguration`
  with the full list and see what comes back; an id the device doesn't have
  is silently omitted from the response rather than causing an error)

This tool may not be available in every environment. If it isn't present or
the call fails, **stop and tell the user** rather than trying to
reconstruct this submodule's field-by-field mapping from memory or from
any locally-cached data -- that's exactly the gap this tool is meant to
fill, not something to work around silently.

The tool's response uses the same status model already established for
time-base/sync in phase 1: `mapped` (with a target MCPWM field name),
`no_equivalent`, or `partial` (a structural change, not a rename -- read
its guidance carefully rather than treating it like an ordinary rename).

### Step 2 -- Resolve shared-field reconciliation, and expect a smaller field set

Global-load fields are instance-wide on MCPWM -- confirmed live, a single
`mcpwmGlobalLoad_gld` field versus EPWM's several separate toggles. Same
reconciliation pattern as dead-band/trip-zone/event-trigger applies if a
group has more than one source instance with differing global-load
settings.

MCPWM's global-load model is also simpler than EPWM's by design -- no
SYNCIN-triggered load, no prescaler counter, no load for `CMPC`/`CMPD`,
`DBCTL`, or action-qualifier continuous software force. Expect most of this
submodule's fields to come back `no_equivalent` from the tool; that's
consistent with the source removal already documented, not a sign
something was missed.

### Step 3 -- Apply the translated values

For each target MCPWM instance, call `changeConfiguration` once (batch that
instance's fields into a single call so they apply atomically; use a
separate call per instance so one instance's failure doesn't revert
another's).

### Step 4 -- Verify

Call `getErrorsAndWarnings`. Confirm it comes back clean before presenting
anything as done -- resolve or report any error/warning before moving on.

### Step 5 -- Save and present the result for confirmation

Call `save`. Then present a report with:

1. **Values applied per target instance** -- pull via `getInstanceConfiguration`
   with `changesOnly: true` on the target instances so the report reflects
   what's actually in the file.
2. **Fields dropped** (`no_equivalent` per the tool) that had a non-default
   value on the source side -- name the source instance and the original
   value, don't just note the id was dropped.
3. **Every pair-substitution / reconciliation decision made explicitly**
   (see Step 2 above) -- which source instance's value was kept, and what
   happened to the others.
4. **Verification result** -- confirm `getErrorsAndWarnings` was clean and
   the file was saved.

### Step 6 -- Stop and confirm before the next sub-phase

**End your turn after presenting the report.** Do not proceed to the next
phase-3 sub-phase in the same turn. Ask the user to review the
pair-substitution/reconciliation decisions from Step 2 specifically, since
that's where a judgment call was made that the user may want to override.
